# android_ap_design_plan
A pure description for my friends to get familiar with android applications.

## Purpose
Due to some reasons our engineering students won't be such familiar with
computer programming; and they don't know what to start with.

My suggestion is, choose the software stuff which could be done only with
a PC; that would make your life easier than those system/platform engineers
since they need to stay close to boards and devices :)

## Get start
First you need to install Android Enviornment to develop android applications.
My suggestion is use Visual Stuido with some plugins; I installed Android
studio one months ago and it could not work any more just because I mis-clicked
update SDK version; now it keeps failing at Gradle sync and finally report error.
:(

1. Install Enviornment
2. Create an empty project with wizard and run it in Emulator, to make
   sure your environment is all OK.

## The first applications
For all games, there need to be a convas. Design an photoview applications that could:
1. Select an picture to be viewed;
2. Put the picture into 100% rate of view in screen, full screen mode;
3. If picture is too big, could use touch to slide windows to view area of this picture.

Go for it!
