# android_ap_design_plan
A pure description for my friends to get familiar with android applications.

## Purpose
Due to some reasons our engineering students won't be such familiar with
computer programming; and they don't know what to start with.

My suggestion is, choose the software stuff which could be done only with
a PC; that would make your life easier than those system/platform engineers
since they need to stay close to boards and devices :)

## Get start
First you need to install Android Enviornment to develop android applications.
My suggestion is use Visual Stuido with some plugins; I installed Android
studio one months ago and it could not work any more just because I mis-clicked
update SDK version; now it keeps failing at Gradle sync and finally report error.
:(

### 1. Install Enviornment
### 2. Create an empty project with wizard; and run it in Emulator, to make
sure your environment is all OK.
